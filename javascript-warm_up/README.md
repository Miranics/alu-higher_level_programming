**JavaScript is used for many things. Here, you will use JavaScript for 2 reasons:

  --Scripting (same as we did with Python)
  --Web front-end
  --For the moment, and for learning all basic concepts of this language, we will do some scripting. After, we will make our AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.
